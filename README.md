## Human Motion Initiated Music Generation

The objective of this project is to enable a single user to create music through movement. The user’s movement will be tracked by the Kinect (version 2) and mapped to sound in real time. The system will be able to automatically generate musical notes based on the changes in velocity, acceleration, and position of a set of skeletal joints in the user’s body.
